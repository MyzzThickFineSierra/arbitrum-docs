The <a data-quicklook-from='arbitrum-nitro'>Arbitrum Nitro stack</a> was designed without native support for specific token bridging standards at the protocol level, but Offchain Labs crafted a "canonical bridge" that ensures seamless token transfers between the parent and child chain. 

This development enhances the interoperability of the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem. 
The token bridge architecture includes contracts located on the  <a data-quicklook-from='parent-chain'>parent chain</a> as well as a complementary set of contracts on the <a data-quicklook-from='child-chain'>child chain</a>. These entities communicate via the <a data-quicklook-from='retryable-ticket'>Retryable Ticket </a> protocol, ensuring efficient and secure interactions. 

For an in-depth exploration of the token bridge mechanism, feel free to consult the [`ERC-20` token bridge overview](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/token-bridge/token-bridge-erc20), which provides insights into the bridge's design and operational dynamics.

### Token Bridge Deployment Steps

Following the [deployment](deploying-token-bridge-with-sdk.md) and initialization of the Orbit chain, the subsequent phase involves deploying contracts on both the parent and child chains. 

To establish and configure the token bridge effectively, the process can be broken down into the following steps: 

1. **[Token Approval](#step-1)**
2. **[ Token bridge contract deployment ](#step-2)**
3. **[ Transaction recipient and checking for deployment on child chain ](#step-3)**
4. **[ Deployment information and contract addresses ](#step-4)**
5. **[ Setting up the WETH gateway ](#step-5)**

The token bridge deployment process depends on the type of Orbit chain. In the following steps, the main flow is the same for all different kinds of Orbit chains except [step 1](#step-1), which is only needed for **Custom fee token** Orbit chains, and [step 5](#step-5), just for `ETH`-based Orbit chains.

:::

### 1. Token Approval (Custom fee token Orbit chains only){#step-1}
Initiating the deployment of a token bridge for **[Custom Fee Token](/launch-orbit-chain/concepts/custom-gas-token-sdk.md)** on orbit chains begins with ensuring the `TokenBridgeCreator` contract is granted sufficient approvals of the native token. To facilitate this process, the Orbit SDK provides two essential APIs:

1. **`createTokenBridgeEnoughCustomFeeTokenAllowance`**: This API is designed to verify that the deployer's address has enough allowance to pay for the fees associated with the bridge token deployment.
2. **`createTokenBridgePrepareCustomFeeTokenApprovalTransactionRequest`**: This API assists in generating the raw transaction required to approve the native token for the `TokenBridgeCreator` contract.

The following example demonstrates how to leverage these APIs effectively to check for and, if necessary, grant approval to the `TokenBridgeCreator` contract:

```js
const allowanceParams = {
  nativeToken,
  owner: rollupOwner.address,
  publicClient: parentChainPublicClient,
};
if (!(await createTokenBridgeEnoughCustomFeeTokenAllowance(allowanceParams))) {
  const approvalTxRequest =
    await createTokenBridgePrepareCustomFeeTokenApprovalTransactionRequest(allowanceParams);
}
```

In this scenario, `allowanceParams` includes the native token details, the roll-up owner's address, and the public client for the parent chain. Initially, the `createTokenBridgeEnoughCustomFeeTokenAllowance` API checks if the deployer's allowance is sufficient. If the allowance is inadequate, the `createTokenBridgePrepareCustomFeeTokenApprovalTransactionRequest` API is called to create the necessary approval transaction.

It is important to note that after generating the raw transaction, the deployer must sign and broadcast it to the network to finalize the approval process.

### 2. Token bridge contract deployment{#step-2}

The deployment of token bridge contracts constitutes the foundational step in establishing a bridge between the parent and child chains. This process mirrors the deployment methodology used for orbit chain contracts, where a primary contract, named `RollupCreator`, facilitates the deployment of core contracts. In the context of token bridge contracts, the `TokenBridgeCreator` contract assumes a similar pivotal role by orchestrating the deployment across both the parent and child chains. Feel free to take a look at the [`TokenBridgeCreator` Solidity code](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/b3894ecc8b6185b2d505c71c9a7851725f53df15/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol#L4).

`TokenBridgeCreator` can deploy the token bridge contracts on both the parent and child chains in a single transaction. A common query is how it manages to directly deploy contracts on the child chain from the parent chain. The solution lies in using the Retryable Tickets protocol, which facilitates the transmission of the deployment message between the two chains. This message, once transmitted, triggers the contract deployment by the Retryable Tickets mechanism. For an in-depth understanding, please refer to this [explanation of the Retryable Ticket system](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#retryable-tickets).

To streamline the deployment process, an API has been integrated into our Orbit SDK, designed to automate the deployment by interacting with the `TokenBridgeCreator` contract. The API is `createTokenBridgePrepareTransactionRequest`, which processes the necessary inputs and generates a transaction request tailored for token bridge deployment. Below is an illustrative example of how to use this API:

```js
const txRequest = await createTokenBridgePrepareTransactionRequest({
  params: {
    rollup: rollupContractAddress,
    rollupOwner: rollupOwnerAddress,
  },
  parentChainPublicClient,
  orbitChainPublicClient,
  account: rollupOwnerAddress,
});
```

In the above example, `rollupContractAddress` refers to the Orbit chain's rollup contract address, and `rollupOwnerAddress` denotes the rollup owner's address. Additionally, `parentChainPublicClient` and `orbitChainPublicClient` represent the public clients for the parent and Orbit chains, respectively, as defined by Viem. For detailed insights into their configuration and usage, consider exploring this [token bridge deployment example](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/blob/main/examples/create-token-bridge-eth/index.ts).

Following the creation of the raw transaction, the next steps involve signing it and broadcasting it to the relevant blockchain network to complete the deployment process.

### 3. Transaction recipient and checking for deployment on child chain{#step-3}

Following the dispatch of the deployment transaction, retrieving the transaction receipt and verifying the successful deployment of the contracts on both the parent and child chains is crucial. Our Orbit SDK includes a dedicated API for this purpose, named `createTokenBridgePrepareTransactionReceipt`, which simplifies the process of obtaining the deployment transaction's recipient. An illustrative use of this API is as follows:

```js
const txReceipt = createTokenBridgePrepareTransactionReceipt(
  await parentChainPublicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash: txHash }),
);
```

In this scenario, `txHash` represents the hash of the deployment transaction initiated in the previous step. The `waitForTransactionReceipt` API from Viem captures the transaction's recipient on the parent chain. The `createTokenBridgePrepareTransactionReceipt` API enhances the basic functionality provided by Viem's `waitForTransactionReceipt`, introducing a specialized method named `waitForRetryables` to handle the outcome (in this case, `txReceipt`).

By employing the `waitForRetryables` method, one can ascertain the success of Retryable Tickets on the parent chain. Here is how to use this API effectively:

```js
const orbitChainRetryableReceipts = await txReceipt.waitForRetryables({
  orbitPublicClient: orbitChainPublicClient,
});

if (orbitChainRetryableReceipts[0].status !== 'success') {
  throw new Error(
    `Retryable status is not success: ${orbitChainRetryableReceipts[0].status}. Aborting...`,
  );
}

console.log(`Retryable executed successfully`);
```

In this example, the `waitForRetryables` method is invoked on the `txReceipt` to monitor the execution of Retryable Tickets and verify their status. A `success` status indicates that the Retryable Tickets have been executed successfully, ensuring the contracts' deployment. It's important to note that this process involves two Retryable Tickets. You can check out a [more comprehensive walkthrough](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/blob/1e39d21eef57d204bfa609c4c29284528ddf05ac/examples/create-token-bridge-eth/index.ts#L78-L104) of the example. This enhanced approach not only simplifies the retrieval of transaction receipts but also provides a reliable method for verifying contract deployment across chains.

### 4. Deployment information and contract addresses{#step-4}

Once we are done with the deployment and are assured that the Retryable Tickets are successful, it's time to get the deployment information and all token bridge contract addresses.
To get this information, we have an API on Orbit SDK named `getTokenBridgeContracts`. You can use this method to retrieve the data for the token bridge recipient.

Here's an example of how to get the contract addresses from the `txReceipt` generated in the previous steps:

```js
  const tokenBridgeContracts = await txReceipt.getTokenBridgeContracts({
    parentChainPublicClient,
  });
```

### 5. Setting up the WETH gateway (ETH-based Orbit chains only){#step-5}
The last step in spinning up the token bridge for an ETH-based Orbit chain consists of setting up the `WETH Gateway`. 

:::note

That step only applies to ETH-based Orbit chains, not Custom fee token orbit chains. Our canonical bridge design has a separate custom gateway for WETH to bridge it in and out of the Orbit chain. 

You can find more info about WETH gateways in our ["other gateways flavors" documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/token-bridge/token-bridge-erc20#other-flavors-of-gateways).

:::

So, after the token bridge has been deployed and you have secured a successful deployment on both parent and child chains, it's time to set the `WETH Gateway` on both parent and child chains. To handle that, we have two APIs on our Orbit SDK:

#### 1. `createTokenBridgePrepareSetWethGatewayTransactionRequest`:
This API helps you create the raw transaction, which handles the WETH gateway on both parent and child chains. 

Here's an example of how to use this API:

```js
  const setWethGatewayTxRequest = await createTokenBridgePrepareSetWethGatewayTransactionRequest({
    rollup: rollupContractAddress,
    parentChainPublicClient,
    orbitChainPublicClient,
    account: rollupOwnerAddress,
    retryableGasOverrides: {
      gasLimit: {
        percentIncrease: 200n,
      },
    },
  });
```

In this example `rollupContractAddress` is the address of Orbit chain's rollup contract, `rollupOwnerAddress` is the address of rollup owner, **parentChainPublicClient** and **orbitChainPublicClient** are the parent and orbit chain public clients. Also this API has optional fields to override the Retryable ticket setups. In this example **percentIncrease** is the buffer to increase the gas limit for the retryable ticket to be sure about the success of the ticket.
After creating the raw transaction you need to use Viem to sign and broadcast the transaction to the network.

#### 2. `createTokenBridgePrepareSetWethGatewayTransactionReceipt`

After sending the transaction, you need get the recept of the transaction to be able to check about the success of the Retryable Tickets created on step 1, which is going to set WETH gateway on the Orbit chain. To do that we are using `createTokenBridgePrepareSetWethGatewayTransactionReceipt` API and also `waitForRetryables` method of it to check for the retryable ticket status. For the example in this doc we can use this API as follow:

```js
  const setWethGatewayTxReceipt = createTokenBridgePrepareSetWethGatewayTransactionReceipt(
    await parentChainPublicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash: setWethGatewayTxHash }),
  );
    const orbitChainSetWethGatewayRetryableReceipt = await setWethGatewayTxReceipt.waitForRetryables({
    orbitPublicClient: orbitChainPublicClient,
  });
    if (orbitChainSetWethGatewayRetryableReceipt[0].status !== 'success') {
    throw new Error(
      `Retryable status is not success: ${orbitChainSetWethGatewayRetryableReceipt[0].status}. Aborting...`,
    );
      console.log(`Retryables executed successfully`);
```

In this example **setWethGatewayTxHash** is the hash of the transaction you sent to set the WETH gateway.
