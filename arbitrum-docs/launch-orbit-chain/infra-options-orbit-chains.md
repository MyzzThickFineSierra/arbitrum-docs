# Infrastructure Options for Orbit Chains

A successful production-grade chain often requires additional surrounding infrastructure to enable app functionality and provide a suberb user experience for those interacting with the network. There are multiple options for various components for deployers to choose from, and the below is a non-comprehensive list of providers that Orbit teams can choose to work with if the need should arise.

## Chain Operation

Many application developers do not have the subject matter expertise required to deploy, operate, and maintain an independent production-grade network. In these cases, we highly recommend working with one of the following RaaS providers who will manage the necessary infrastructure and ensure a high degree of performance and security for your chain:

- [Caldera](https://www.caldera.xyz/)
- [Conduit](https://conduit.xyz/)
- [AltLayer](https://altlayer.io/)
- [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network/)

## Bridges

Orbit chains are easily launched with a canonical token bridge which permits transfers to and from their chain via Arbitrum One, Nova, or Ethereum. However, some applications may desire the ability to transfer to additional chains outside of the Orbit ecosystem or want to offer the ability to transfer across chain more quickly, without waiting for complete finality. In these instances, the following 3rd party bridging providers offer services to meet those needs:

- [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/)
- [Connext](https://www.connext.network/)
- [Hyperlane](https://www.hyperlane.xyz/)
- [Axelar](https://axelar.network/)
- [Across](https://across.to/)

## Data Availability

Deployers of Orbit chains may offer cheaper fees on their chain by storing the data posted in batches on an alternative Data Availability solution rather than to Ethereum directly. The built in functionality in Anytrust allows these developers to easily configure the cost of transacting and will enable more powerful features with additional chains that are also using Anytrust. However, there are integrations with Orbit that are available for those that would prefer to use one of the following third party services:

- [Celestia](https://celestia.org/)
- [EigenDA](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/)
- [Avail](https://www.availproject.org/) (coming soon!)
- [Near](https://near.org/data-availability) (coming soon)

## Indexers

In order to surface necessary application information, teams frequently require additional indexing capabilities. Fetching application specific or historical information is difficult or impossible to do directly from an RPC. Fortunately, there are multiple data services providers that are familiar with operating this type of infrastructure, and may be willing to do so for your chain.

- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)
- [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/)
- [Ormi](https://www.ormilabs.xyz/)

## Oracles

Many applications require external data to be published on-chain in order to function properly. This data is usually either price feeds related to assets utilized in app or a source of verifiable randomness. The following oracle providers may be able to support your chain:

- [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)
- [Pyth](https://pyth.network/)
- [Redstone](https://redstone.finance/)
- [Randomizer](http://Randomizer.ai) (VRF only)
- [Supra](https://supra.com/)

## RPC

RPCs are the primary interface for users and developers to interact with any chain, whether it be for transaction submission, reading state, or indexing historical data. There is often a need for robust RPC services for public consumption as well as for specific projects with higher rate limiting requirements. The following providers may support your Orbit chain:

- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/)
- [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
